Hi Team,
  
Here is information on the **`r params$portfolio`** as of `r Sys.Date()`:

```{r}
# embed a table with some of the numeric data in the email 
sign_formatter <- formatter("span",
  style = x ~ formattable::style(color = ifelse(x > 0, "green",
    ifelse(x < 0, "red", "black")
  ))
)

portfolio_selected %>%
  arrange(desc(date)) %>%
  head() %>%
  format_table(
    x = .,
    list(returns = sign_formatter)
  )
```


Let me know if you have any questions!
